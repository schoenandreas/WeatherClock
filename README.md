# WeatherClock

WeatherClock displays the weather forecast for the next 12 hours for your current location in a "clock-UI" design. The current hour is marked by colour and the current weather is also shown above the clock.

This project is not designed to be published to the playstore since the used Dark Sky Api is limited to 1000/calls per day.
